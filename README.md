This project focuses on analyzing motor vehicle sales across various counties in Colorado using SQL-based data processing and exploratory analysis. The dataset contains detailed information segmented by year and quarter, providing insights into vehicle sales trends and the economic landscape of automotive transactions in the state. The objective of this project is to clean, organize, and analyze the dataset through SQL queries to derive meaningful business insights such as identifying top-performing counties, understanding quarterly and yearly sales patterns, and measuring growth trends over time. The project also includes steps for data preprocessing, such as handling inconsistent values, removing duplicates, and formatting columns for structured querying.
